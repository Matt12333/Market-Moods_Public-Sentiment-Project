<h2>Project Overview</h2>

This is my Digital Futures Capstone Project. Having an interest in the financial markets, I had always heard that how you should never follow the crowd when trading/investing. This prompted myself to use Natural Language Processing to discover if this was accurate or not.   
The final outputs of the code files are the:
- Sentiment of the week
- % Change in Price for the Selected Week
- % Change in Price for the Following Week

The '% Change in Price for the Following Week' is included to see if there is a lag between the public sentiment and the change in market price.

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
I required two types of data for this project: Public Sentiment Data and Stock Market Data.  
  
- Public Sentiment Data: [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)   
- Stock Market Data: [Interactive Brokers API](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#api-introduction)

<h3>Script Purposes</h3>

- main.py: Contains two functions, to select a certain week of data and return the: Sentiment of that week, % Change in Price of Selected Week, % Change in Price of the Following Week
